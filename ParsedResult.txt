
A unique feature of colloid particles and biopolymers is the molecule's intrinsic rigidity charac-
terized by a molecular-level length scale. Under extreme confinement conditions at cellular scales
or in nano-devices, these molecules can display orientational ordering accompanied by severe den-
sity depletion. Conventional liquid-crystal theories, such as the Oseen-Frank or Landau-de Gennes
theories, cannot capture the essential molecular-level properties: the boundary effects which extend
to a distance of the rigidity length scale, and the drastic variations of the inhomogeneous molec-
Illar density. Here we show, based on a simple interpretation of the Onsager model, that rodlike
molecules in extreme annular confinement produce unusual liquid-crystal defect structures that are
independent phases from the patterns usually seen in a weaker confinement environment.
Introduction.— The fluid formed by rodlike molecules is
a model system of liquid-crystals, which is often consid-
ered in computer simulations. Closely related real sys-
tems are micron-sized colloidal silica rods Ill or visible-
range granular rods 12, 31 that display typical behavior
of lyotropic liquid crystals: formation of a nematic state
when the particle density is sufficiently high and exhibi-
tion of defect patterns when the orientationally ordered
system is confined in a finite space. A prominent feature
of biopolymers and colloid particles is the molecule's in-
trinsic rigidity characterized by a molecular-level length
scale. Recent experimental systems include aqueous sus-
pensions of actin filaments [4] and linearly shaped viruses
[5] confined in a microchamber. How does the finite ge-
ometric confinement affect the orientational properties
and local molecular densities of a liquid crystal made of
molecules that have sizes competing with the confinement
length scale?
One might say that this question is already answered
by the recent progress in liquid-crystal physics. The sub-
ject of liquid-crystal defects caused by geometric frustra-
tions has been one of the central focuses in the liquid-
crystal research community in recent years. The de-
fect morphologies appearing in single and double liquid-
crystal emulsions [6, 71, liquid-crystal display cells [81, as
well as confined semiflexible biomolecules [4, 5], are ex-
cellent experimental examples. The molecular-level com-
puter simulations produced defect patterns under vari-
ous physical conditions [9—16] that furthered our under-
standing of the nature of the defects. Most theoretical
studies in this research area 115, 17—35] are based on
the Oseen-Frank (OF) model or the Landau-de Gennes
(LdG) model, where the nematic director field or the
Q-tensor field 1361 are the main concerns, respectively.
These coarse-grained models, in which the molecular in-
dividuality is mostly ignored, are suitable for dealing with

liquid crystals made of small molecules.
The case of liquid crystals under extreme confinement
is outside the realm of the conventional OF or LdG mod-
els, when the molecular size is comparable with the con-
finement dimension. Here the nonlocal boundary effects
can extend to a significant distance covering a several
rigidity length scale. Such a key physical feature cannot
be described by the OF and LdG theories, as they are
models for local order parameters. An excellent example
is rodlike molecules, each having length L, confined in
the annular area formed by two concentric circles of radii
RI and R,2, as illustrated in Fig. I. Recent experiment
observations and computer simulations revealed molec-
ular configurations that are unique to such finite-sized
systems [141. The excluded-volume interaction between
rods prefer mutually parallel alignment of rod axes. In
an ideal bulk state without a boarder, this drives the
molecules into the formation of a directionally-ordered
but spatially-homogeneous nematic state at a sufficiently
high particle density. The hard annular boundaries dis-
rupt the uniform nematic order and produce defect states
in the interior. Depending on the geometric ratios 112/ L
and RI/R2, molecular configurations display multiple
stable states, each characterized by particular rotational
symmetries.
Can we understand the stability of these states from a
theoretical model? The OF model deals with a contin-
uum, nematic director field and the LdG model a con-
tinuum, Q-tensor field, in which two crucial mechanisms
required for the current problem are lacking: a rod can-
not cross any hard-wall boundaries, illustrated in Fig.
I(b) and the density depletion caused by such a bound-
ary condition (BC) produces an entropy cost to the free
energy. Hence, we need another level of coarse-graining,
a free-energy model that contains a continuum field vari-
able and yet allows for specification of BCs at a molecular
level.
In 1949, Onsager proposed an idea for studying the
orientational properties of rodlike molecules [371. The
purpose of this Letter is two-fold: to demonstrate that

model treats the problem at a different level: the con-
sideration is the molecular distribution density, not the
continuum local nematic-director or the Q-tensor fields.
When the numerical analysis is done, we show that a
unique set of extreme-confinement states emerge, which
are different from the defect states predicted from the
conventional OF or LdG models.
Theoretical approach.— Our focus is on the distribution
density function pc(r, u) in a flat two-dimensional (2D)
space. It characterizes the probability density of finding
the centers-of-mass of rodlike molecules at a spatial po-
sition specified by the vector r with the condition that
the rods point at the direction specified by the unit vec-
tor u. The normalization condition fdrfdupc(r, u)
is assumed here where n is the total number of confined
rodlike molecules in an area A. We follow Onsager's ap-
proach 1371 to write the free energy of the system by using
a Mayer expansion accurate to the second virial term 138],

two terms. The first term takes into account the transla-
tional, density-depletion, and orientational entropies of
a spatially inhomogeneous and orientationally ordered
fluid of rodlike molecules. The second term describes
the interaction between two rodlike molecules having the
coordinates (r, u) and (r', u'), where the Mayer function

ergy between the two rigid molecules. When the config-

free energy for interacting, rodlike molecules. An overall num-

the number of rods per unit area on a two-dimensional sur-
face. The phase boundaries are determined by a comparison
of the free energies. The color of the rods illustrated in (c)

FIG. 2: Defect structures under the extreme confinement
condition. Three illustration methods are used, all based
on the numerical solution of pc(r, u). The first row in each
plot is a reconstructed, real-space illustration; the second
row is the scalar orientational order parameter, calculated
from the distribution function; the third row is the center-
of-mass distribution function, after averaged over all orienta-
tions. The first-order phase boundaries separating Dm from
D'rn are represented by the change of the background shades:
from white to light gray, where rn = 2, 3, and 4 in plots
(a) (for RI/R„2 0.1), (b) (for RI/R„2 0.3), and (c) (for
RI/R2 = 0.45), respectively. The color used in the first row
of each plot has the same meaning as in the inset of Fig.
I (c). The intensities of both A and are represented by the
blue color bar. The light blue and green circles indicate the
defect locations on Dm, of —1/2 and 1/2 winding numbers,
respectively.
boundaries. The BCs amounts to letting the density
pc(r, u) vanish, when a rod, having coordinates (r, u),
3
overlaps with any part of the two concentric circles. This
non-local interaction has a correlation length of order L,
which cannot be ignored when RI, R2 and L become
comparable. The second, nonlocal term in (I) connects
the density function at different locations. After solv-
ing the minimization condition in (2) for the entire
space, we can then deduce the normalized density func-
tion by averaging over all directions, and the Q(r)-
tensor for any r. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
Q-tensor also yield the scalar orientational order param-
eter A(r) and the main-axis nematic director n(r) [44].
The numerical solution reveals the existence of two
different types of defect states, Dm and D' , each dis-
playing an m-fold rotational symmetry [Fig. 11, where
m = 2, 3, 4, The extreme defect states D'm are char-
acteristically identified to have the strong presence of
self-aggregation of the center of mass [Fig. 21. Accom-
panying the density depleted regions are weakly ordered
rod segments, which can be compared with a much more
clear signal of defect points in Dm. At a low R2/L ra-
tio, the geometric frustrations due to the BCs reduce the
available free space for the rodlike molecules and effec-
tively drive up the excluded-volume effects; rich domains
of rod centers with orientationally ordered configurations
reduce the overall excluded volume effects, in the expense
of unwanted reduction of the translational entropy in the
polar-angle direction.
In addition to these effects, at the inner and outer cir-
cular boundaries, the configurational properties of D'
significantly differ from those of D m. At r 112 and
r RI, both A(r, p) and n(r, p) vary as functions of p
and the variation becomes stronger as R,2/L decreases,
under extreme confinement. In contrast, these boundary
properties remain at almost constant values in Dm. In
a typical treatment of the LdG theory for a confinement
problem, is assumed to be a constant over the en-
tire confined space; at the boundaries, A(r, p) is assumed
to be a constant and n(r, p) to point at a constant an-
gle from the boundary tangent direction. Indeed, a LdG
theory can describe the T)2, Doo and spiral states [32, 331.
Phase transitions.— The fact that D'm and Dm are dif-
ferent defect phases can be assessed from the free-energy
branches of these two types of states. Displayed on the
left panel of Fig. 3 are the typical free energies of these
states, where RI/R2 = 0.1 form 2 in plot (a), 0.3
for m 3 in plot (b), and 0.45 for m 4 in plot (c).
The plots clearly show how the D'rn and Dm
branches
cross each other at the transition points, as R2/L varies.
These and other crossing points (not displayed in Fig.
3) are used for the final determination of the first-order
phase boundaries in the phase diagrams, Figs. I(c) and
(d). Through the eigenvectors of the deduced Q-tensor
at r R2, we calculate the nematic angle at the bound-
ary. The variance of this angle, a , can be used as the
order parameter for this transition, as displayed in Figs.
3(d-f). The jumps at the transition points clearly indi-
cate the strong variations of the nematic angles in the
TY states.

For

each
case of (a) m = 2, (b) m 3, and (c) m 4, two branches of
the reduced free energy per rod, triangles for D'm and circles
for Dm, are plotted in (a), (b), and (c). The variance of
the nematic direction at r RD, , is used as the order
parameter of the D'm-Dm transitions and displayed in (d),
(e), and (f) for m = 2, m = 3, and m = 4, respectively.
Jumps of (T can be seen at the transition points.
In a continuous vector field, a winding number can be
assigned to a field-defect point. As a general rule, the
total sum of the winding numbers in a given geometry
is always conservative [17, 45—471. One can argue, e.g.,
that the annuler confinement amounts to a total winding
number zero, and the circular confinement total winding
number +1 1431. Indeed, the ideal annular Doo is a state
without any defect. The continuous Dm states contain m
pairs of defect points that can be assigned positive and
negative winding numbers [see Fig. 2], and hence the to-
tal winding number is still zero. The —1/2 defect points,
labeled in Fig. 2 by the blue color, appear near the in-
ner circle. As the ratio RI/R2 decreases, these —1/2
defect points are attracted to the vicinity of the inner
circle, which has an increasing curvature (another prop-
erty of liquid crystal defect points 1451). This is consis-
tent with the observation from Monte Carlo simulations
1141. As RI/R,2 goes to zero, the annular confinement
approaches the limit of a circular confinement of radius
R2. The two —1/2 defect points in the D2 state dimin-
ish together with the inner circle, leaving a total winding
number m/ 2 +1 for m 2, expected for the circular
confinement [42, 43]. This crossover requirement alone
4
establishes the fact that the low-RI/R2 Dm state must
be D2, not other m.
Although the density functions pc(r, u) of the extreme
D' states are continuous, they vary drastically in both
r- and u-variable spaces. This makes the orientational-
configuration variation almost disruptive, as can be seen
on the left panel of Fig. 2. As the result, significant
regions of A = 0 appear in the order parameter profile,
where the concept of defect points becomes irrelevant. In
a recent theoretical study of a semiflexible polymer chain
confined in a spherical cavity, a density depletion region
is also found under the extreme confinement condition,
when the confinement dimension has the same order of
magnitude as the persistence length of the polymer 1481.
This places the applicability of the general theory of de-
fect points in question, on the extreme defect states.
There are two types of steric-repulsion effects in the
current model. One is the boundary effects that com-
pletely forbid typical configurations illustrated in Fig.
I(b). A long rod (small 112/ L) cannot fit into the inte-
rior of the annular geometry, which determines the lower
bound of the phase diagram in Fig. I(c) 144]. The other
type is due to the Mayer function —w. While v -4-00
when two rods overlap, illustrate by examples in Fig.
I(a), the Mayer function allows the configuration but
with a "soft" energy penalty w 1, appearing in Eq.
I. As such the Mayer function more appropriately ap-
proximates a thin, 2D-like layer of rodlike molecules. In
some extreme states, the continuum cl)c varies drastically
crossing depletion and non-depletion regions, but is still
continuous due to the soft penalty.
Summary.— A distinguishable feature of the Onsager
model is its simplicity: a term describing entropy and
a term the excluded-volume interaction. The origi-
nal model was proposed to describe the bulk isotropic-
nematic transition. Yet, the extended version to include
the spatial variation gives the model a new life —
it
can be used to describe much more complicated, liquid-
crystal problems of today's interest.
Here we demonstrate its capability of describing the
physics of extreme confinement through nonlocal bound-
ary conditions,where the conventional Oseen-Frank and
Landau-de Gennes models fail to capture [32, 33]. A rich
phase diagram is obtained — not only the states of dif-
ferent rotational symmetries are separated by phase-tran-
sition boundaries, but two separate phases of the same
symmetry are identified. Our free-energy calculation pro-
vides a theoretical foundation to establish the liquid-crys-
tal properties under extreme annular confinement, for
which Monte Carlo configurations were reported recently
